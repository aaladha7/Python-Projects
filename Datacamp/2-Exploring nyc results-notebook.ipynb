There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.\n\n///\n\nWhich NYC schools have the best math results?\n\nThe best math results are at least 80% of the *maximum possible score of 800* for math.\nSave your results in a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools, including \"school_name\" and \"average_math\" columns, sorted by \"average_math\" in descending order.\nWhat are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\n\nSave your results as a pandas DataFrame called top_10_schools containing the \"school_name\" and a new column named \"total_SAT\", with results ordered by \"total_SAT\" in descending order (\"total_SAT\" being the sum of math, reading, and writing scores).\nWhich single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\n\nSave your results as a pandas DataFrame called largest_std_dev.\nThe DataFrame should contain one row, with:\n\"borough\" - the name of the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation of \"total_SAT\".\n\"num_schools\" - the number of schools in the borough.\n\"average_SAT\" - the mean of \"total_SAT\".\n\"std_SAT\" - the standard deviation of \"total_SAT\".\nRound all numeric values to two decimal places.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools =
